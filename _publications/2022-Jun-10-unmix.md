title: "
Transfer Learning with Jukebox for Music Source Separation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-Jun-10-unmix
excerpt: 'In this work, we demonstrate how a publicly available, pre-trained Jukebox model can be adapted for the problem of audio source separation from a single mixed audio channel. Our neural network architecture, which is using transfer learning, is quick to train and the results demonstrate performance comparable to other state-of-the-art approaches that require a lot more compute resources, training data, and time. We provide an open-source code implementation of our architecture (https://github.com/wzaielamri/unmix).'
