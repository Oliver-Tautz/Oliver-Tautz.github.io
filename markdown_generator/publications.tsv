Transfer Learning with Jukebox for Music Source Separation"	"
IFIP International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations"	In this work, we demonstrate how a publicly available, pre-trained Jukebox model can be adapted for the problem of audio source separation from a single mixed audio channel. Our neural network architecture, which is using transfer learning, is quick to train and the results demonstrate performance comparable to other state-of-the-art approaches that require a lot more compute resources, training data, and time. We provide an open-source code implementation of our architecture (https://github.com/wzaielamri/unmix).	Zai El Amri, W., Tautz, O., Ritter, H., Melnik, A. (2022).
