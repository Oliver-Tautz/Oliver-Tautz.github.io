Hi! I'm a research assistant at Bielefeld University. 

My interests include many **AI** topics such as *natural language processing*, *generative AI*, *computer vision*, *audio signal processing* and general *machine learning*.

Additionally, I am a huge **linux** nerd and like to try out new niche software. Feel free to contact me for any reason :)
